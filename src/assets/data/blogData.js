      "​A seed drill is an innovative farm machinery used in agriculture that allows farmers to conveniently and speedily plant seeds deep into the soil instead of just leaving on top soil. Its been notices that in spreading seeds manually, majority of seeds gets washed away, or even eaten by birds or otherwise lost. With the new evolutions in agriculture farmers have also started using different types of machines on farms in various tasks Earlier the seed drill machines were pulled by horses and consisted of rotating drills that would plant seeds at a fixed level of depth. Modern seed drills are pulled by tractors so farmers are now able to complete the seed sowing process faster. The modern seed drills use improved seed sowing methods so that farmers can get the job done in half the time without any risk of loosing seeds.The use of a modern farm machinery like a disc seed drill in farming practices also makes a huge impact on environment. Using disc seed drills allows farmers to save water consumption in farming, which is specially required in areas where water is limited. With less water use farmers can plant crops in the lands that were earlier entirely unworkable."

      " Nowadays latest farming methods and techniques are used to improve the production practices on farms. Different types and variety of hybrid seeds of a single crop, technically advanced farm equipment and lots of energy is used to supply irrigation water, pesticides and fertilizers. The most commonly used agricultural  machinery and equipment in farming  are mentioned below-  Tractors, combines, balers, planters, ploughs, mower and sprayers. We can say that overall farming is no longer an easy process, but rather a complex procedure that needs huge and complex machines to work on thousands of hectares. The efficiency of today’s farm process is also necessary to provide the huge population in all over the world any food it wants at any time. ",

      "In modern agriculture, different types of multi functional machines are used for various purposes. A combine harvester is a versatile farm machinery which is used for harvesting of grain crops as harvesting grain is more complicated process in comparison to other vegetable crops. A combine harvester is mainly designed to harvest various grain crops. It is very popular among grain farmers due to its capability to harvest more than 82 types of grain crops including rice, wheat, corn, sunflowers, barley, clover, etc.A combine harvester performs different steps of harvesting such as reaping, threshing, Winnowing into a single process and this why its why it is called combine harvester.NOW LET’S KNOW ABOUT WHAT IS REAPING, THRESHING AND WINNOWING?Reaping -- In the process of reaping, a combine harvester cuts the crops from the yield field.Threshing — In the process of threshing, a combine harvester separates the seeds from stalks.Winnowing — In the process of threshing, a combine harvester removes chaff from the stored grain and produces high-quality grain.Since a combine harvester is a piece of very useful equipment for farmers. Due to the combine harvester, farmers can save labour cost as well as time to plant new crop in the same field in minimum time. Farmers also increase productivity by the use of this harvesting machine.TYPES OF COMBINE HARVESTER. In the current time mainly two types of combine harvester are available in the market.1. Manually control Combine harvester2. Self-propelled or Automatic Combine Harvester MANUALLY CONTROL COMBINE HARVESTERAs it is known by its name, all the processes that are done to get the crop from the field, are to be done by combine harvester machine attached to the tractor. That’s why it’s also called a tractor pulled combine. Such combine harvesters cannot do all the work themselves with their power. It takes help from the tractor for doing the following: Threshing Cutting Separating Cleaning (Winnowing) SELF-PROPELLED OR AUTOMATIC COMBINE HARVESTERSuch Combine Harvesters are very powerful and have all the things related to harvesting from wheels to grain tanker. And it has a powerful engine which does all these tasks simultaneously.",
