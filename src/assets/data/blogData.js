She says the government is planning to make the fertiliser distribution process more well-managed and scientific.Following the subsidy cut decision, the prices of all kinds of chemical fertilisers had gone up. A kilogram of urea was made costlier by Rs 11 than its previous price whereas DAP and potash were made more expensive by Rs 7 and Rs 9 per kilogram respectively."
